# OpenCV-Filter-and-Blur
This was a project for my computer vision course in which I preformed different types of blur on a provided image using the OpenCV library. I preformed boxblur, Gaussian Blur
and Motion blur. I had to do this manually as the assignment stated that we were not allowed to use the built in OpenCV blur function calls
